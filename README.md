Module 10


**File Location** 
All files for the assignment can be found in the main folder of this repository.

For the first part of the assignment, the syntax is saved in the file climate_starteripynb." The analyses are self-contained in that jupyter file.

The other file of note is the app.py file. This file contains both the syntax for part 1 and the app development syntax for part 2. 

**Syntax Sources**
I did recieve some assistance from teaching assistants on the first part of the assignment, mainly with the syntax to locate the most recent point in the precipitation analysis.  All of the remaining code was self-generated or was copied/altered from class material with no outside sources copied. I did look at a few websites to make sure I was setting up multiple filters correctly. However, no code was copied from those websites.
